write a spec for a CLI tool "ntnts" which uses polars-ls and octopolars to use github or a local repo as the source for a tool for MutaGReP style (execution free repository-grounded plan search for code-use), which is to say using LLMs to generate "intents" and then embedding them using polars-fastembed, no *necessary* dependency on qdrant like in the original but planning to extend out to use qdrant and lancedb like in the industry standard software engineering solutions (just not in the MVP). the intents are descriptions of the purpose of each symbol in the code (for example classes/objects correspond to nouns with associated purpose intents of storage/data containers etc while functions/methods as symbols represent intents for verbs like performing modification/storage routines and so on). the general idea is to collect the discrete units of purpose-oriented meaning of a codebase and thus to produce a [natural language, then vector embedding] representation of a codebase artifact [i.e. an inventory of files].
